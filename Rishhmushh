    <h1>My Dear Princess Hazara Risha Muskan ❤️</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Your Highness,</strong> from the very first moment you stepped into my life, everything around me transformed into something softer, warmer, and infinitely more beautiful. Your presence carries a grace that cannot be described with simple words, and your heart shines with a light that brightens even my darkest thoughts. The way you speak, the way you care, the way your eyes hold entire universes of emotion — it all leaves me in awe of the extraordinary woman you are.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is a quiet strength within you that inspires me every single day. You carry kindness like a crown, compassion like a royal robe, and love like a timeless treasure. Being loved by you feels like being chosen by destiny itself. Every laugh we share, every conversation that stretches into forever, becomes a memory carved deeply into my soul. With you, love is not just a feeling — it is a powerful force that makes life richer, deeper, and endlessly meaningful.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I imagine my future, I see it illuminated by your smile and protected by your gentle spirit. You are not only my princess — you are my peace, my happiness, and my greatest blessing. Loving you is a promise I make with certainty, devotion, and pride. No matter where life takes us, my heart will always bow only to you.
    </p>
